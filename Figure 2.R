### This file produces Figure 2 of the paper

## NOTE
## the produced plot differs from the paper version in appearance
## this is to limit dependencies on external packages
## to reproduce exaclty the same plot as in the paper uncomment the final lines
## final theme depends on devtools and hrbrthemes being installed
